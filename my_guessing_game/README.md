====================
I have created this Repository to submit my first assignment for the course. The assignment is to create a guessing game.

My guessing game will be to have the user guess how many Major League Baseball teams there are today. If they guess it correctly, they will receive a notification congratulating them of this. I've added some logic operators for the below:

		-- If the user's guess is less than 10, they will receive the message "Sorry! Your guess is too low. Please refresh the page to try again."
		-- If the user's guess is greater than 10 AND less than 20, they will receive the message "Almost there! Please refresh the page to try again."
		-- If the user's guess is greater than 20 AND less than the answer variable, they will receive the message "Super close! Please refresh the page to try again."
		-- If the user's guess is greater than the answer variable, they will receive the message "Ouch. You've guessed a higher number than the number of teams. Please refresh to try again."
